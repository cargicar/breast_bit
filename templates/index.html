  Nowadays Artificial Intelligence is becoming an important tool within medicine and health areas. Machine Learning (ML) and Deep learning (DL) has been widely used and has achieved remarkable success in many medical imaging applications.  In this app, we use a DL model to classify masses in mammograms as malign or benign, in order to create an alert system that allows radiologist and physicians to pay closer attention to suspicious cases. </br></br>To train the model, we have used  transfer learning methodology.
